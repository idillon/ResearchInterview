From here, you can download the zip file for the repository and then decompress it, or you can clone the repository into a desginated file
To run:
1. Open two VMs
2. Obtain files from repository
3. Open terminals/command prompts in both
4. Navigate to folder in which files were placed
5. Run the command javac AgentSystem.java in both terminals
6. Once they are compiled, run java AgentSystem PingAgent on one VM, and java AgentSystem PongAgent on the other
